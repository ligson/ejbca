<section name="EJBCA PKI CA">
<p>
EJBCA<sup>&#174;</sup> is a PKI Certificate Authority software, built using Java (JEE) technology. 
Robust, flexible, high performance, scalable, platform independent, and component based, EJBCA can be used stand-alone or integrated with other applications.
</p>
<p>
Being extremely scalable and flexible, EJBCA is suitable to build a complete PKI infrastructure for any large enterprise or organization. If you only want to 
issue a few single certificates for testing, there are probably other options that will get you started quicker, but if you want a serious Certificate Authority 
to manage your Public Key Infrastructure, we recommend EJBCA. 
<br/>Investigate the links below to understand more what EJBCA really is.

<li>Signing and encrypting email (SMIME).</li>
<li>VPN connections by issuing certificates to your VPN routers such as OpenVPN, Cisco, Juniper etc.</li>

<li>Create CVCAs and DVs and issue CV certificates (CVC) to Document Verifiers and Inspection Systems for EU <a href="docs/cvccas.html">EAC ePassports</a> and eIDs.</li>
<li>... and many many more ...</li>
</ul>
</subsection>
<note>
You can also use EJBCA to set up a CA independent, high performance, highly available OCSP responder service.

<ul>
<li>Get central trusted <a href="https://signserver.org">Time Stamps</a> for you electronically signed documents.</li>
<li>Perform <a href="https://signserver.org">central signing of documents</a>.</li>
<li>Sign electronic passport data (MRTD).</li>
<li>Issue hard tokens (<a href="complementary.html#Hardware%20tokens">smart cards</a>) and manage the complete life cycle of cards and certificates.</li>
<li>... and many many more ...</li>
</ul>
  <note>
  The cert-cvc library handles CVC certificates for EU EAC ePassport PKIs and the current release is 
  feature complete for EU EAC ePassports using all algorithms.
  <br/>
  The library is freely usable under the LGPL 2.1 (or later) license for all parties interesting 
  in handling CVC certificates, in particular for EU EAC ePassports.
